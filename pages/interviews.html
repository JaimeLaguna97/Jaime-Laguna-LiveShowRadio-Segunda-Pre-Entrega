                                    called, a work conscientiously constructed that places him as a producer no longer

                                    studio, but at the beginning of the pandemic I didn't understand anything and I
                                    couldn't make music, it was a shock, I imagine for everyone. With David, my boy, I
                                    decided to start with streaming and use different backgrounds, since I saw that the
                                    ones people did from home were very similar. We reused the materials that we had
                                    here, in the field, since at that time it was impossible to leave. We made one with
                                    trees as if it were a forest, then another with paintings... Luckily, with this I
                                    was having a lot of fun.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">A few years ago, the musician Gaetan Juif was dedicated to
                                    atmospheric black metal, composing and playing in bands that have quite a few
                                    followers: Cepheide and Basilique. But his, on a musical level, covered a much
                                    broader spectrum of sounds that, in the long run, ended up coming into direct
                                    contact with various styles of electronic music. With this idea, his Baume project
                                    was born, which in times of confinement released an EP, Un Calme entre les Tempêtes.
                                    It has earned the label of experimental, although it is simply a somewhat lazy way
                                    of cataloging sounds that encompass very diverse electronic influences.</p>

                                    Fixon, born in the eighties in Mexico, is one of the pillars of techno and

                                    affable, agile with words possibly thanks to his interest in literature and all
                                    kinds of art, with a fine and elegant sense of humor, in mid-2021 I was lucky enough
                                    to share an extensive talk with the founder of ANAØH Records and Vector Functions
                                    along with Dig-it.</p>
